      "no prohibition exists.\\ \\ 2. **No Factual Errors:**\\    - Based on standard\n",

      "- In competitive swimming, post-flip turn kicking depends on shoulder\n",
      "positioning similarly explained in the reference, making the output consistent.\\\n",
      "\\ 3. **Addressing All Parts of the Question:** \\     - The question inquires\n",
