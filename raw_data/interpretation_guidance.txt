If a rule is ambiguous, the swimmer should be given the benefit of the doubt and no disqualification should be assessed.

An in-water forward start is allowed for butterfly, breaststroke, and freestyle. 

For an in-water forward start, the swimmer shall have at least one hand in contact with the wall and facing away from the starting end toward the course.

For backstroke, freestyle and butterfly, once a swimmer surfaces, they must remain on the surface, they cannot resubmerge except during a turn.

In the freestyle leg of the individual medley or medley relay, the swimmer shall remain on the breast at all times while swimming except when executing a turn. 

Freestyle is the only stroke that allows a swimmer to return to the wall if they miss the touch at the turn.  The swimmer must do this before touching the other end of the pool.  In all other strokes, if the swimmer misses the wall, the swimmer is disqualified.

To determine if swimmer is on the breast or back when leaving the turn, first look at the swimmer's feet first losing contact with the wall, then look at the shoulders to determine if the swimmer is on the breast or back.
